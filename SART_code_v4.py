""" Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)

Author: Cary Stothart (cary.stothart@gmail.com)
Date: 05/11/2015
Version: 2.0
Tested on StandalonePsychoPy-1.82.01-win32

################################# DESCRIPTION #################################

This module contains the standard SART task as detailed by Robertson et al. 
(1997). 

This module is modified by CruX 2023 Team 6 to adapt to our own distraction experiment.
We will overwrite some parts of the code without explicit markings.

This code is for NUMERICAL STIMULATION
    CB CONDITION 1 USES THIS IN STAGE 1
    CB CONDITION 2 USES THIS IN STAGE 3

The modifications made are noted here as well on github:
    Collected participant's phone usage in hours [part_info_gui()]
    Added counterbalancing condition: 
        1: stage 1 uses numStim and stage 3 uses alphaStim
        2: stage 1 uses alphaStim and stage 3 uses numStim
    Reduced the number of blocks to 6 [sart()]
    Changed the number of repetitions of all 9 digits within each block to be 7 [sart()]
    Reduced the circle and X stimuli down just to the + stimulus with smaller font [sart_trial()]
    Got rid of font size as a variable [sart_block()]
    Randomize 3 blocks excluding block 1 to be distraction blocks [sart()]
        of which randomize 3 trials to play distraction sound concurrently [sart_block()]
    Added two T/F columns to indicate whether the current block or trial is distraction or not [sart_block(), sart_trial()]
    
The following task attributes can be easily modified (see the sart()
function documentation below for details):
    
1) Number of blocks (default is 1)
2) Number of font size by number repetitions per trial (default is 1)
3) Target number (default is 3)
4) The presentation order of the numbers. Specifically, the
   numbers can be presented randomly or in a fixed fashion. (default is random)
5) Whether or not practice trials should be presented at the beginning of the 
   task.
   
How to use:

1. Install PsychoPy if you haven't already.
2. Load this file and run it using PsychoPy. Participants will be run on the 
   classic SART task (Robertson et al, 1997) unless one of the sart()
   function parameters is changed.

################################## FUNCTIONS ##################################

Self-Contained Functions (Argument=Default Value):

sart(monitor="testMonitor", blocks=1, reps=5, omitNum=3, practice=True, 
     path="", fixed=False)
     
monitor......The monitor to be used for the task.
blocks.......The number of blocks to be presented --> 6 blocks
reps.........The number of repetitions to be presented per block.  Each
             repetition equals 9 trials (1 font size X 9 numbers). --> 7 repetitions
omitNum......The number participants should withhold pressing a key on. --> 3
practice.....If the task should display 18 practice trials that contain 
             feedback on accuracy. --> no
path.........The directory in which the output file will be placed. Defaults
             to the directory in which the task is placed.
fixed........Whether or not the numbers should be presented in a fixed
             instead of random order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9,
             1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...).
